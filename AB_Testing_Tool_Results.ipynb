        "\n",
        "*A/B test results for the four conversion metrics (add_payment_info, add_shipping_info, begin_checkout, new_account), split by test number and device type (desktop, mobile, tablet):*\n",
        "\n",
        "Each row represents: one test number (1–4); one device (desktop, mobile, tablet); one metric with conversion rates and a z-test to check statistical significance (p_value < 0.05)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Key Metric Overview:\n",
        "- add_payment_info / session:\tOnly some tests/devices show significant improvements (e.g., test 1 desktop/mobile)\n",
        "- add_shipping_info / session:\tMostly not significant, small effect sizes\n",
        "- begin_checkout / session:\tShows most consistent and significant improvements across multiple tests/devices\n",
        "- new_account / session\tRarely significant, very small differences\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Detailed Metric Findings:\n",
        "- **add_payment_info / session:** The test variant had better performance in test 1.\n",
        "  Significant increase in test 1: Desktop: +11.4%, p = 0.007; Mobile: +17.1%, p = 0.0007; Tablet: +36%, p = 0.0458. Other tests: mostly small or insignificant changes\n",
        "\n",
        "- **add_shipping_info / session:** Slight benefit in some groups, but generally low impact across devices.\n",
        "  Test 1 Desktop: +12.2%, p = 0.00033.\n",
        "  Test 4 Desktop/Tablet: small significant improvements.\n",
        "  Most other results are non-significant (p > 0.05)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **begin_checkout / session:** This metric consistently improved in the test group — high potential impact metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Significant in Test 1, Test 3, and Test 4 across multiple devices:\n",
        "\n",
        "        Test 1 Desktop: +14.3%, p = 0.000003;\n",
        "        Test 1 Tablet: +33%, p = 0.0149;\n",
        "        Test 3 Tablet: +26%, p = 0.0046;\n",
        "        Test 4 Mobile: +4.3%, p = 0.0268.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **new_account / session:** Test variants did not significantly affect new account creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Test 4 Desktop: Slightly significant increase (+3.8%), p = 0.035;\n",
        "\n",
        "    All others: not significant (p > 0.1), sometimes even lower in the test group.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Final takeaways:\n",
        "- Prioritize **begin_checkout / session** as a key success indicator.\n",
        "- Audience\tImprovements most effective for desktop and mobile users.\n",
        "- Test 1 variant likely contained beneficial changes, especially for payment + checkout\n"
